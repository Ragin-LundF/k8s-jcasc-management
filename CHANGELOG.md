# 1.9.0
Adding support for deployments in other namespaces.

With the following section in the `jenkins_helm_values.yaml` it is possible to add other namespaces to the RBAC binding.
This allows Jenkins to deploy applications into those namespaces later on a CI/CD pipeline.


```yaml
k8smanagement:
  rbac:
    # list of additional namespaces that should be deployable (adds RBAC roles to those namespaces)
    additionalNamespaces: []
```


# 1.8.0 #
- Improved scripts
  - Missing dialog for apply secrets to a namespace added
- Support for dummy entries in `ip_config.cnf` file
  - can be used for IP reservation
  - configuration of the prefix for dummy entries can be done with the `IP_CONFIG_FILE_DUMMY_PREFIX` variable
- `whiptail` support

    - `whiptail`
    - `dialog`
    - `nodialog`
